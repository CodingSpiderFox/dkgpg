.SH NAME
dkg\-keysign \- threshold signature scheme for OpenPGP (only DSA/DSS)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dkg\-keysign
.RI [ options ]
.IR PEERS

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program generates certification signatures for all valid user IDs of a
given OpenPGP public key. The private DSA key for the signature scheme of the
issuer has been shared between multiple parties by
.BR dkg\-generate (1).
That means, for successful signing at least 2s+1 different participants must
join the protocol and provide their corresponding shares. The threshold
parameter s has been fixed during distributed key generation and cannot changed
at this stage of processing.
.PP
By the option "\-r" certification revocation signatures are generated, and with
the option "\-U" a policy URI for all generated signatures can be specified.
.PP
Currently, only DSA/DSS is supported as public-key algorithm of the issuer due
to limitation of the threshold signature scheme from LibTMCG. The program needs
the public key block (e.g. downloaded from a key server) to sign (option "\-i")
and the corresponding privat key file as generated by
.BR dkg\-generate (1).
.PP
The program employs GNUnet for exchange of protocol messages, where PEERS must
be a sufficient subset (i.e. at least 2s+1) of the GNUnet peer identities used
during distributed key generation with
.BR dkg\-generate (1)
including the identity of the calling peer.
.PP
With the option "\-w" the number of minutes can be adjusted until the
distributed signing protocol is started. The default value is 5. It is crucial
that all required participants are connected with GNUnet CADET within this
waiting time. Otherwise the certification may fail.
The option "\-W" defines the timeout of a message within the point\-to\-point
network. The default value is 5 minutes. If the underlying network transport
(i.e. GNUnet CADET or TCP/IP) is very slow then this value should be increased
by all particpants. 
.PP
The established communication channels for the protocols should be protected
with bilateral exchanged passwords for encryption and message authentication,
if the underlying P2P network does not guarantee the required confidentiality
and integrity by itself. The passwords for all channels are defined as a
string, where a slash (/) marks the end of each single password. The order of
the passwords depends on position of each peer in the canonicalized peer list,
i.e., the sorted unique list of given PEERS. For example, if participant S_0
uses "A/B/C/" as its password string, then "B" is the password for his channel
to S_1 and "C" is the password for his channel to S_2. That means, S_1 and S_2
must provide matching password strings, i.e., "B/D/E/" and "C/E/F/",
respectively. The default value of option "\-P" is an empty password string
(simple default passwords) based on the assumption, that GNUnet will protect
the exchanged protocol messages.
.PP
Additionally, instead of relying on GNUnet CADET service the messages can be
exchanged by the built\-in TCP/IP communication framework. In that case the
given peer identities from PEERS must be resolvable hostnames and the
corresponding option "\-H" defines the name of the calling peer within that
list. The program binds some TCP ports up from 55000 to listen for incoming
connections and connects to other peers in that port range. The used port
numbers are determined by the unique position in the canonicalized peer list.
Since the communication of TCP/IP is not protected by the network itself
the option "\-P" is mandatory in that case.

.SH "SECURITY"
The current implementation is in experimental state and should NOT

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
The following command creates a certification signature on the last user ID of the public key provided in input file foo.asc with three participants defined by their GNUnet peer identities (3PT1...4530, S41S...G3N0, WS3K...QKFG). The signature attached to the key is written in armored OpenPGP format to bar.asc and can be verified by any OpenPGP implementation.

.PP
At least 2s+1 parties must run such a process on the same input, i.e., public key and user ID. The program waits ten minutes before the threshold signature
protocol is started, because establishing a CADET channel with GNUnet may take some time.
