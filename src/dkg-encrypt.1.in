.SH NAME
dkg\-encrypt \- simple message encryption with AES\-256 according to OpenPGP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dkg\-encrypt
.RI [ options ]
.IR KEYFILE

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program encrypts a (text) message read from STDIN according to the OpenPGP standard.
KEYFILE must contain the ASCII-armored public key, for which the following encryption is
performed.
.PP
First, AES\-256 is applied as symmetric cipher with a randomly chosen 256-bit session key.
Finally, the session key is transformed by PKCS#1 v1.5 block encoding and encrypted with
the ElGamal public-key algorithm. Note that an integrity protection packet (MDC) is appended. 
.PP
Currently, as public-key algorithm only ElGamal is supported and all certifying signatures
in the corresponding subkey packet of the public key must be DSA signatures. This is due
to the limitation in distributed key generation of LibTMCG.
.PP
The encrypted message in ASCII-armored OpenPGP format is written to STDOUT and later it
can be further processed with
.BR dkg\-decrypt (1).

.SH OPTIONS
