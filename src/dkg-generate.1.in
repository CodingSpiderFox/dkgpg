dkg\-generate \- distributed key generation for OpenPGP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dkg\-generate
.RI [ options ]
.IR PEERS

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program implements the t\-resilient distributed key generation protocol (DKG)
by Gennaro et al. for discrete logarithm based cryptosystems as described in
.I "Journal of Cryptology, Vol. 20(1), 2007".
Additionally, it can perform the adaptively\-secure threshold DSS protocol (tDSS)
by Canetti et al. for generating a shared DSA key as proposed in the extended
version of a paper appeared under the title
.I "Adaptive Security for Threshold Cryptosystems"
in the proceedings of CRYPTO'99. Both protocols employ GNUnet or a simple built\-in
TCP/IP service as underlying peer\-to\-peer (P2P) network for exchange of internal
protocol messages between the participants. Thus either a working GNUnet peer or
an interconnected host with appropriate TCP/IP port forwarding (e.g. via Tor
Hidden Service) is necessary to proceed. Otherwise only local test instances
with limited useability are started.
.PP
For each party either an individual or a shared DSA signing key is generated.
This key acts as OpenPGP's primary key. Then the shared ElGamal encryption key
is arranged as subkey. Thus each party should verify after key generation, that
the published public key of the group contains this shared ElGamal key, if no
shared DSA signing key is used as integrity measure. The program generates two
different files: First, one file that stores the individual private key shares in
ASCII\-armored OpenPGP format (experimental public\-key algorithm IDs 108 an 109),
and second, another file that contains the public keys again in ASCII\-armored
format. These files have as a common prefix of their filename the GNUnet peer
identity or the hostname of the calling party, i.e., the corresponding string
from the n\-element list
.IR "PEERS". 
The first file must be kept confidential. A passphrase can be used to protect
the private keys by a simple OpenPGP S2K encryption scheme. If an empty passphrase
is entered, then the corresponding secrets are stored in plain text and have
to be protected otherwise.
.PP
The parameter t determines how many parties may deviate from the DKG protocol
during the key generation and later during threshold decryption. At least
t+1 participants are needed to recover a key share or to decrypt a OpenPGP
message. This parameter can be adjusted by using the option "\-t". The default
value is (n\-1)/2 where n is the number of participants. If the program is
called with a zero t\-resilience (i.e. "\-t 0"), then no ElGamal encryption
subkey is generated. It is always ensured by clipping that t <= n holds.
.PP
The option "\-s" defines the parameter s, i.e., the s\-resilience of the tDSS
protocol. At least 2s+1 participants are required to create a signature of the
shared DSA primary key, however, s+1 parties can recover all secret key shares.
The default value for s is (n\-1)/2. The generation of an unique shared DSA
key is disabled, if parameter s is set to zero. In that case individual DSA keys
are generated which allow full control over the shared encryption subkey.
.PP
The underlying DDH\-hard group, i.e., a large prime\-order subgroup of special
form (sometimes called Schnorr group), can be tweaked by using the option "\-g"
with a common reference string (CRS) also known as domain parameter set. The
included program
.BR dkg\-gencrs
generates such a string on that all participants must agree. The security
level is increased for each remaining dummy argument of dkg\-gencrs.
The generated domain parameters are verifiable up to a certain
level. In particular there is an option for compliance with FIPS 186\-4.
However, it is recommended that this crucial part of the setup is either
accomplished by some trusted members or all participants together.
Without option "\-g" a hard coded group with |p| = 2048 bit and |q| = 256 bit
is used by default. It was created by the author of the program at random
and is fully compatible with DSA as defined in RFC 4880. Other choices may
not be supported by all OpenPGP implementations.
.PP
With the option "\-w" the number of minutes can be adjusted until DKG/tDSS
protocols are started. The default value is 5. It is crucial for the key
generation that all participants are connected with GNUnet CADET within
this waiting time. Otherwise the distributed key generation may fail.
The option "\-W" defines the timeout of a message within the point\-to\-point
network. The default value is 5 minutes. If the underlying network transport
(i.e. GNUnet CADET or TCP/IP) is very slow then this value should be
increased by all particpants. 
.PP
The established private communication channels for the protocols should be
protected with bilateral exchanged passwords for encryption and message
authentication, if the underlying P2P network does not guarantee required
confidentiality and integrity by itself. Moreover, the broadcast channel
has to be authenticated too. The passwords for all channels are defined
as a string, where a slash (/) marks the end of each password.
The order of the passwords depends on position of each peer in the
canonicalized peer list, i.e., the sorted unique list of given PEERS. For
example, if participant P_0 uses A/B/C/ as password string, then "B" is
the password for his channel to P_1 and "C" is the password for his channel
to P_2. That means P_1 and P_2 have to provide matching password strings,
i.e., B/D/E/ and C/E/F/, respectively. The default value of option "\-P" is
an empty password string (simple default passwords) based on the assumption,
that GNUnet will protect the exchanged protocol messages.
.PP
Additionally, instead of relying on GNUnet CADET protocol the messages can
be exchanged by the built\-in TCP/IP communication framework. In that case
the given peer identities from PEERS must be resolvable hostnames and the
corresponding option "\-H" defines the name of the calling peer within that
list. The program binds some TCP ports up from 55000 to listen for incoming
connections and connects to other peers in that port range. The used port
numbers are determined by the unique position in the canonicalized peer list.
Since the communication of TCP/IP is not protected by the network itself
the option "\-P" is mandatory in that case.
.PP
The included program 
.BR dkg\-keyinfo
shows some basic information about threshold parameter and the private key.
Finally, the program
.BR dkg\-refresh
updates the individual DSA key shares and thus provides so\-called proactive
security against a mobile adversary, if it is used regularly. The refreshment
should be handled very carefully because all parties not involved are excluded
(disqualified) from all further private key operations.

.SH OPTIONS
Arguments mandatory for long options are also mandatory for short options.
Please note that interpreting of almost all options is done by a library
function of GNUnet. Thus this program has to be compiled accordingly.

.SH "SECURITY"
The current implementation is in experimental state and should NOT
be used in production environments. Note that for the key generation
a lot of good randomness is required. Please ensure that your
system can provide these randomness for libgcrypt without exceeding
the defined protocol timeouts.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
The following command initiates a distributed key generation with four participants defined by their GNUnet peer identities (WS3K...QKFG, XS72...4ZVG, 3PT1...4530, S41S...G3N0).

.PP
Each party must run such a process with identical parameter set, i.e., please configure always the same t\-resilience. Note that,
e.g. 2\-resilience, means that later at least three participants are needed in order to decrypt messages for the generated common
ElGamal subkey. However, robustness of the DKG protocol is only guaranteed for t < n/2 which is violated in this example. Thus a
malicious party may disturb the key generation without being identified and excluded. The s\-resilience is set to zero, which
means that individual DSA keys instead of a shared key are generated and used as OpenPGP primary keys. Thus
.BR dkg\-sign (1)
will not work with such restricted keys. The program waits ten minutes before the DKG protocol is started, because
establishing a CADET channel with GNUnet may take some time.
.PP
Instead of using GNUnet for message exchange the built\-in TCP/IP service (currently IPv4 only) can carry out this job. However,
then each peer has to be reachable by all other peers over the underlying network. In this case resolvable hostnames instead
of GNUnet peer identities are used as unique identifiers: 
.nf
.RS
dkg-generate -t 2 -P secret1/secret2/secret3/secret4/ -H host2.example.com host1.example.com host2.example.com host3.example.com host4.example.com  
.RE
.fi
The s\-resilience is non\-zero in this example, which means that a shared DSA key is generated and used as OpenPGP primary key. Thus
the shared encryption subkey (ElGamal) is protected against individual manipulation. This subkey is generated with a default
threshold of t = (n\-1)/2.
.PP
Last but not least, in the following example only a shared DSA key, e.g. for jointly code signing, is generated:

dkg-generate -t 0 -P secret1/secret2/secret3/ -H supertapir evilsloth supertapir lazyhedgehog

You can start the program with torsocks to use Tor as underlying point\-to\-point network. Note that for this case the option
"AllowInbound" must be enabled in torsocks.conf. Additionally, a hidden service with port redirection to localhost has to be
configured in your torrc file:
.nf
.RS
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/dkg/
HiddenServicePort 35000 127.0.0.1:35000
HiddenServicePort 35001 127.0.0.1:35001
