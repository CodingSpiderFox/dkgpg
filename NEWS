1.0.5   Major improvements have been achieved in this release: For signing
        of a OpenPGP public key (certification) the program dkg-keysign was
        added. With dkg-keycheck and the option "-r" some basic checks on
        RSA keys can be performed. Two new options ("-f" and "-t") enhance
        the prossiblilities of dkg-verify. A new option for dkg-encrypt make
        use of zero key ID encryption privacy. Last but not least, memory
        locking and secure memory allocation have been implemented.
1.0.4   Since this release not required OpenPGP packets will be ignored.
1.0.3   Only small bugfixes are included in this release. However, the most
        recent version of LibTMCG is required to recognize some important
        library changes (e.g. increased S2K count for secret key encryption).
1.0.2   This release brings small improvements for dkg-keyinfo and fixes
        some bugs and memory leaks. It also adjusts the flags of shared DSA
        keys generated with dkg-generate due to a hidden RFC 4880 requirement.
        DKGPG now additionally contains the program dkg-keycheck for analyzing
        other public DSA and ElGamal keys w.r.t. some basic properties.  
1.0.1   Small improvements have been achieved in this maintenance release:
        First, the program dkg-keyinfo now contains the option "-m" to migrate
        an abandoned peer identity. However, the choice is limited in some
        sense, because the new peer identity must have the same lexicographical
        position within the canonicalized peer list as the old one. Moreover,
        all active parties are required to do this migration in a coordinated
        way since the peer list is stored as part of the private key. Second,
        the echo of passphrase characters are removed when reading from STDIN.
        Finally, some memory leaks found by Valgrind have been fixed. Please
        note that this release requires LibTMCG version >= 1.3.5.
1.0.0	This is the initial release of Distributed Privacy Guard (DKGPG).
