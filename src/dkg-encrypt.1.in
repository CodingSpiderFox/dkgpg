.SH NAME
dkg\-encrypt \- simple message encryption with AES\-256 according to OpenPGP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dkg\-encrypt
.RI [ options ]
.IR KEYFILE

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program encrypts a (text) message read from STDIN or a file according to the OpenPGP
standard. KEYFILE must contain the ASCII\-armored public key, for which the encryption is
performed.
.PP
First, AES\-256 is applied as symmetric cipher with a randomly chosen 256\-bit session key.
Finally, the session key is transformed by PKCS#1 v1.5 block encoding and encrypted with
the ElGamal public\-key algorithm. Note that an integrity protection packet (MDC) is always
appended.
.PP
Currently, as public\-key algorithm only ElGamal is supported and all certification and
subkey binding self-signatures in the corresponding subkey packet of the public key must
be DSA signatures. This is due to the limited OpenPGP support in LibTMCG.
.PP
The encrypted message in ASCII\-armored is written to STDOUT or to an output file and can
later be processed with
.BR dkg\-decrypt (1).
There exists also an option to write out the encrypted message in binary OpenPGP format.
However, for obvious reason this must be an output file and not STDOUT. 

.SH OPTIONS
Arguments mandatory for long options are also mandatory for short options.
