.SH NAME
dkg\-encrypt \- simple message encryption with AES\-256 according to OpenPGP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dkg\-encrypt
.RI [ options ]
.IR KEYFILE

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program encrypts a (text) message read from STDIN or a file according to
the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880). KEYFILE must contain the ASCII\-armored
public key block with either any encryption-capable subkey (recommended) or
an encryption-capable primary key (used to last resort), for which the actual
encryption is performed. If more than one valid admissible encryption subkey
is found in the key block, than the generated symmetric session key is
encrypted for each of these keys. 
.PP
First, AES\-256 is applied as symmetric cipher with a randomly chosen 256\-bit
session key. Finally, the session key is transformed by PKCS#1 v1.5 block
encoding and encrypted with the corresponding public\-key algorithm. Note that
an integrity protection packet (MDC) is always appended.
.PP
With the option "\-t" the included key ID is thrown away, i.e., instead a
"wild card" or speculative key ID is used. This format helps to reduce traffic
analysis of messages. 
.PP
Currently, as public\-key encryption algorithms only RSA and ElGamal are
supported due to the limitation of LibTMCG.
.PP
The encrypted message in ASCII\-armored is written to STDOUT or to an output
file and can later be processed e.g. with
.BR dkg\-decrypt (1).
There exists also an option to write out the encrypted message in binary
OpenPGP format. However, in that case for obvious reason an output file must
be specified with option "\-o".
